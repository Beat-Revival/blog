# Progress Report 3

Welcome to our third progress report. This post will cover everything we've done since our last report.

---

In the last post, I mentioned how we were focusing on TDF decryption/encryption. Since then, compatibility has massively increased, and we're starting to see the effects.  
We've now gotten compatibility to the point where the client successfully completes the initial handshake with the server and starts to send requests to the server's web API.

We've made huge progress in terms of Beat L.Es. We're now at a point where Beat L.E functionality is starting to come through with a few bugs still present (for example, right now Beat L.Es will disappear after restarting the client). A lot of values are still hardcoded, though, so it's still not ready for prime time.

Lots of people were also curious as to if Beat Revival would restore achievement functionality. Well, take a look for yourself.

Here's a list of the other stuff we've gotten working since the last progress report:

- Runner kit unlocks
- Player stats (progress)
- Player info (division, tags, echoes)

For now, that is all. Thank you for reading :)
